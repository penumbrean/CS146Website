            <h2>Immersion</h2>
            <p>When using virtual reality, users are immersed in the world or surroundings that are presented to them. The feeling of being inside and a part of the world shown, as well as being able to interact and influence the environment, is what immersion is all about. According to researcher Jonathan Steuer, immersion is composed of two parts; Depth of information and Breadth of Information. The first refers to both the ammount as well as the quality of information the user is exposed to, while the breadth is the "number of sensory dimensions simultaneously presented."</p>
            <p> Most virtual reality systems focus on two main senses; sight and sound. Being able to look around and hear your surroundings is incredible for most to expierience right now, but that is only scratching the surface of what is possible. Many are researching how to allow for haptic feedback, or letting users receive a sense of touch as well as sight or sound.

                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <p>The sensory output from a virtual reality system should be cohesive with what the user is doing. If the user would stand still, they should not be recieving the sense that they are running. In order for this to be as convinicing as possible, the actions the user goes through need to be replicated as soon as the user does them. If there is a lag between when the user expects to see or hear something and when he or she actually does, that often will suspend the feeling of being in vitual reality. This lag is called latency. Latency is something that should be avoided as much as possible, as any lag immediately makes the user aware of the real world around them.</p>

                <h2>Interactivity</h2>

                <p>In order for a virtual environment to feel lifelike, the user must be able to interact with their surroundings. This interaction can be broken down into three parts, speed, range, and mapping. Speed in this situation would be how fast the computer tracks the user's movements. Range would be how many results could stem from the user's action, and mapping would be how well the system can create results based on the user's actions. </p>
                <p>Interactivity can step from a number of different things. Just being able to control a character's movement in a virtual reality would make it an interactive experience. However, true interactivity requires the user to be able to modify their surroundings. A well made virtual reality environment will react to the user's actions in a way that makes sense, even if it only makes sense in the virtual environment. </p>
