                <h2>The Sensorama</h2>
                <p>The idea of the Sensorama was thought of by Morton Heilig in 1955, who later actualized his idea in 1962. The Sesorama was a multi-sensory theater which he though would be the theater of the future.</p>

                <h2>The first Headsets</h2>
                <p>In 1968, Sutherland and Sproull, created a VR headset that was mounted to a computer rather than a camera. Prior to this VR was only used for military or flight purposes, but this introduced the idea of VR to the public.</p>
                <p>It was rather primitive and could only show simple shapes, but this was a step in the right direction.</p>

                Nasa created the View headset in 1985, it was designed to test concepts of showing information to pilots or astronauts.

            <h2>Sterographics</h2>
            <p>Sterographics were what first gave the concept of virtual reality to engineers. By using two images that are slightly misaligned, stereoscopes trick your brain into thinking the image you are looking at is three dimensional. Instances of stereographics have been traced all the way back to the Roman Empire. </p>

            <h2>How the VR changed Gaming</h2>
            <p>Soon video games began to take advantage of the VR to make new games with interesting features. One of the first companies to do this was SEGA.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The present</h2>
            <p>Now we have lots of popular names that we think of when we hear the word VR. Mainly Oculus by Meta, HTC VIVE, and others coming and being made. Not only that but with time more applications of VR came into being not just for gaming purposes. Wall street journal made a VR roller coaster, BBC created a 360 view of a Syrian migrant camp, and Washington Post made a VR experience of the oval office. The key here is that we are still learning and making brand new ideas that use VR.</p>
